In many real-world scenarios, images captured in low light or nighttime conditions often suffer from poor visibility, making it difficult to discern important details. This problem is especially prevalent in critical fields such as autonomous driving, where clear and accurate visual data is crucial for decision-making. Object detection in low-light conditions is crucial for various applications, including recognizing pedestrians, vehicles, and animals in autonomous driving systems or identifying intruders in surveillance footage. By employing semantic segmentation, different object categories are color-coded for easy identification. These advancements help create more accurate and reliable systems that can effectively operate in challenging visual environments, ensuring safety and efficiency in critical applications.
